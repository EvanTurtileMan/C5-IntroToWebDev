		    In this tutorial class, you will learn how to develop some simple applications on the web. Whenever we surf the web, we are constantly accessing and using these applications. For example, we use Google to search up our items of interest or we go to Youtube to watch interesting videos uploaded by many users. Sometimes, we play games on our browsers! The list goes on. As you might expect, the contents of this course will demonstrate how one may go about creating such an application and how to deploy it into the real world.
		</div>
		<div class="containerOtherBody">
		    When you join this class, you will be creating simple web applications using Node.js. We will be covering the essentials first before we go into tougher concepts such as backend creation and security within the Node.js application. Be mindful that although this is a course where you apply your knowledge in projects and labs, you will be learning the concepts and theories as well.

		    Welcome to the C5 tutorial class: Introduction to Web Development! In this intermediate-leveled tutorial class, you will learn how to develop simple web applications through the use of Node.js. During the 10 weeks in this tutorial course, you will learn the essentials of web development, from how to design a webpage through HTML and CSS to how to develop the backend of your Node.js web application. Of course, although you learn the theory of how to develop such web applications, you will also apply your knowledge and practice how to create web applications. 
		</div>
		<div class="section" id="enrolment">
		    To enroll into the C5 tutorial course, you must send an email to Evan Chen (the tutorial course instructor). His email is evanturtile.chen@gmail.com (evanturtile[dot]chen[at]gmail[dot]com). For the course to be initiated, there must be at least 5 students enrolled into the course with 15 students maximum enrolled into the course. Enrolment into the course will start on January 2nd, 2018 and will end on January 13th, 2018. If you are placed on the waitlist, please keep on checking back with Evan if you are still able to join the class. Please note that there is no fee to enroll into this particular class.
		</div>
	        <div class="section" id="scheduleInfo">
		    The C5 tutorial class will start on January 20, 2018. The classes will be weekly; it will be held every Saturday for 10 weeks at U of T's Robarts Library (in the St. George Campus study rooms) and it will be held at 1 pm in the afternoon until 4 pm (depending on how fast we go, there may be a chance that we can leave early). Usually, each lesson will be divided into two parts: learning the theory and the essential skills, and the coding portion. After the 10th week, there will be a test based on the theory we have learned. All project work given in this tutorial course will be due a week after the test has been given. Please take a look at the lessons page on the course website to check the schedule of the tutorial course.
		</div>
		<div class="section" id="gradingScheme">
		    There will be work distributed throughout this tutorial course's 10 weeks. Among this work, there will be 8 different labs to help guide you along the lessons, 2 projects to help give you an understanding of how to develop applications on the web, and a course-end test that covers all topics taught in the course. Please take a look at the course grading scheme down below.

		    By the end of this tutorial course, you will receive a numerical mark that will show up on your course_PORTaL account. For those who achieve one of the top three marks in the class, you will each receive a gift. (Please note: the gift will also depend on your position in the top ranks!)
		</div>
		<div class="section" id="labsInfo">
		    In this tutorial class, there will be 8 labs in total, with each lab having a weight of 3% of your final mark. Each lab will be given to you at the end of each lesson. It is in your best interest to attempt each lab as they guide you alongside the lessons given to you. Please note that when you hand in your lab, you MUST hand in your work through the Github lab repository that the course instructor gives you. Any work that is present there before the due date will be marked. Any other work uploaded there after the due date will not be marked. Please take a look at the labs page on the course website to have a feel of what labs may be offered. Please note that these labs will be short; usually, you may need to just fill in a few blank spots (such as filling in a function).
		</div>
		<div class="section" id="projectsInfo">
		    In this tutorial class, there will be two projects. These projects help you apply the knowledge and theory you have learned throughout this tutorial class. The first project will be based on lessons and labs of Weeks 1 to 3 (it is mainly based on frontend design) while the second project will be based on lessons and labs of Weeks 4 to 10 (which includes backend implementation, but it will be built up on top of Weeks 1 to 3, which is given). Please note that these two projects have to be very different from each other; you cannot build on from your first project and then pass it off as your second project. Each project should help you apply your knowledge on frontend design and backend implementation and allow you to practice and understand even more. You may recycle SOME ideas from your first project and carry it over to your second project, but you cannot build on top of your first project. Of course, you cannot upload your lab work and call it off as your second project; otherwise, you will receive a mark of 0. These two projects will be due a week after the course-end test (which is in April 2018). The course instructor will give you a few ideas that you can work with for both projects in-class. Just like the labs, you must use Github to upload your work. On the second project, you may work in groups of 2 or 3, and never alone. However, on the first project, you MUST work by yourself as it is just frontend design.
		</div>
		<div class="section" id="testInfo">
		    In this tutorial class, there will be a course-end test you will have to write. It will account a hefty 30% of your final mark in this tutorial class. It will cover all topics taught in this tutorial class. You will be given 120 minutes to write this test; you are allowed to write your own cheat sheet (8 x 11 inches, double sided) and you may bring it to the test. 
		</div>
		<div class="section" id="githubInfo">
			In this tutorial class, you MUST use <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> to be able to hand in your work. What is Github? It is a service that allows you to post your work in a "folder" called a repository (which is unique to the work you post into it). You can allow other collaborators to join (those you want to work with) a particular repository, and you can share work with many others. Github acts like a portfolio of sorts for us Computer Scientists and Software/Computer/Electrical/(insert engineering title here) engineers, sort of like how art students save their art work in a portfolio folder. You should only upload your work on Github; do NOT send me an email containing a zip folder of your work and do not give me any Dropbox links containing your work. Do not scp your work to me as well... I will only check Github and mark what is inside the repository I have shared with you/the repository you have shared with me.
		</div>
		<div class="section" id="coursePortalInfo">
		    In this tutorial class, we will be using "course_PORTaL", an application that was created from bottom-up by yours truly, just for your convenience! This web application details all of the courses you have joined in the past and will show your current final mark based on the work you have handed in and what has been marked. It will be also a place to share Github links with me if you have created your own repositories and would like to hand in those repositories instead. With each work you hand in, everything marked will be shown on course_PORTaL. The instructor will create an account for you; you will receive your username and password through text/email. You can change your password through this application.

			So far, we took a look at the basics of HTML. When we code in this markup language, we are using HTML markup tags that allow us to add content to the webpage we are currently writing on. Sometimes we can stylize the content. Sometimes we can emphasize content. It depends on what you want on your webpage.

			This lesson is one of the essential building blocks that a web developer must know, not in the sense that this language revolves around web development 100% of the way (seeing that you can also use Java or Python or etc. as part of your backend infrastructure). We take a look at a few things when learning about JavaScript: writing to the console, using variables, creating functions, making loops, and initializing objects.
