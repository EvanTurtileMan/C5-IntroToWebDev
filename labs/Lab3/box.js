    /* Go nuts in this program. A box has to have
     * something the moment you open it up, right? :)
     * Surprise me! (You MUST have at least a couple of
     * methods inside this object that can run once
     * called!!)
     *
     * Some suggestions can include the following:
     *    - A box can have the length, width, and height
     *    - A box can contain some delish candy!
     *    - A box can be a house (can this even be practical?)
     *    - ...and much more!
     * This exercise is to help you understand how
     * Object Oriented Programming (OOP) works. */
